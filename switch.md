# 🚀 JuliaOS Bounty Program

> **Important:**  
> It’s **JuliaOS**, *not* Julep. Please conduct proper research and **integrate JuliaOS correctly** into the project.  
> Ensure **clean replacement of Julep with JuliaOS**, and verify your implementation works **without bugs or errors** before submission.

## 🧠 About JuliaOS

**JuliaOS** is a modular, open-source framework for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered agents and swarms across multiple blockchains. It blends the high-performance **Julia language** with a flexible dev stack, including **Node.js CLI** and **Python bindings**, and a powerful **agent framework** for onchain/offchain execution.

For non-technical users, JuliaOS includes a **no-code dApp builder**, offering the same AI + swarm capabilities through an intuitive visual interface.

## 🎯 Mission

Build a fully functional decentralized application (dApp) powered by the **JuliaOS framework**.  
Your dApp should demonstrate the flexibility and power of JuliaOS through real-world AI agent usage, swarm orchestration, and cross-chain deployment.

> ⚠️ Reminder: Submissions must not include Julep.  
> Ensure all Julep dependencies are **replaced with JuliaOS** components, following the documentation.  
> **Test thoroughly** — the final implementation must be bug-free and production-ready.

## 🔍 Scope of Work

### ✅ Required:
- **Agent Execution**  
  Implement autonomous or LLM-powered agents using `agent.useLLM()` or related JuliaOS APIs (see Gitbook).

### 🟡 Optional (Bonus Points):
- **Swarm Integration**  
  Use JuliaOS swarm APIs to orchestrate multiple agents.

- **Onchain Capabilities**  
  Interact with Solana smart contracts or make onchain queries via JuliaOS's blockchain interfaces.

- **Custom Frontend (UI/UX)**  
  Build a tailored frontend with your preferred stack if your dApp needs a specialized interface.

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Cross-Chain Arbitrage Bot**  
  Swarm of agents finds arbitrage opportunities across DeFi platforms.

- **Web3 Gaming Companion**  
  AI assistant manages in-game assets and optimizes user strategy.

- **DAO Governance Advisor**  
  Analyzes proposals and predicts voting results using LLMs.

- **Web3 Research Assistant**  
  Automates blockchain project research and risk analysis.

- **On-Chain Compliance Agent**  
  Traces suspicious transactions across chains and visualizes fund flow.

---

## ✅ Submission Requirements

1. **Create a public GitHub repo** for your JuliaOS-powered dApp.
2. Include:
   - `README.md` with:
     - Setup instructions
     - Description of how JuliaOS is used (agent logic, swarm handling, etc.)
   - Link to any working **demo** or deployment
   - Relevant test scripts or mock scenarios
3. **Submit** the repo link via the **Earn Bounty platform**
4. **Complete the Feedback Form**
5. Follow us on **X** and **join our Discord** (assign yourself the `Developer` role)

> 🔄 **Replacing Julep?**  
> Your README must clearly describe how Julep was removed or replaced.  
> JuliaOS should be fully integrated **without conflicts**, **legacy dependencies**, or broken functionality.

---

## 📋 Development Requirements

- **Code Quality**  
  Follow JuliaOS naming conventions and style guidelines.

- **Documentation**  
  Clearly document your dApp’s purpose, setup, and usage of JuliaOS features.

- **Testing**  
  Include working tests or sample scenarios to validate your logic.

- **License**  
  All submissions must be **MIT license–compatible**
